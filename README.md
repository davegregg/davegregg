## Hello, I am David Michael Gregg ðŸ‘‹
*But most people know me as **DMG***

### I am a software engineer and a professional explainer of things with twenty years of experience with Web technologies and public speaking. I have taught thousands of people to code â€“ through private mentorship, The Iron Yard (now-defunct), and [Kenzie Academy](https://kenzie.academy)/[SNHU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_New_Hampshire_University).

Among engineering fields, software engineering is still very much _unsettled._

Look at the paradigm shifts in this field. What it means to build software _changes_ every 5 to 15 years! This is a field which may have had its Galileo, perhaps its Newton. But the field itself is still very much in active development. 

We must not assume that the syllabus of the last decade is the best we can do for the art, for our learners, our teams, our goals. You are on the cutting edge of a field which is _still_ young and naive. Let's discover â€“ together â€“ what it means to express human designs through language and machines.

  <summary><strong>What do I <em>specialize</em> in training?</strong></summary>
  
- fundamentals of programming to _absolute_ beginners â€“ regardless of background or prerequisites.
- code quality, by helping learners develop both concrete understandings and intuition â€“ especially when it comes to readability and edge cases.
- debugging strategies, metacognitive approaches to ideation & problem-solving, and pseudocode.
- assessing code quality quantitatively for identifying refactoring opportunities, using Jim Weirich's approach to [Connascence](https://youtube.com/results?search_query=jim+weirich+connascence) â€“ an evolution of Coupling & Cohesion introduced in the late 70s for the Structured Paradigm.
- trainers.

  <summary><strong>What have I been thinking about lately (2021)?</strong></summary>

_The gist:_ I'm looking for solutions to learning obstacles in software engineering â€“ particularly for career changers and learners with little education.
  
- Comparative study of programming paradigms and other organizational/architectural patterns to seek generalizations which may transcend paradigms.
- The relationships between self-identity, first impressions, growth mindset, and affirmative cultures for teams and learning groups.
- Identifying abstraction gaps between beginners and fundamentals â€“ the use of _functions_ in programming in particular.
- Functions from the perspective of Lambda Calculus â€“ this has been enlightening because it highlights core feature distinctions between functions in Lambda and functions in most programming languages.
- Abstraction vs. Indirection
